# LaTeX résumé

My résumé using LaTeX. To build it you should install the nedded
tools. See the next session.

## Tools

The tools being used for development are:

+ [Visual Studio Code]
  + [LaTeX Workshop extension]
+ [MiKTeX (for Windows)]

To build a `.pdf` from the `.tex` file, go to LaTeX Worshop's side
bar entry and click on `Build LaTeX project/Recipe: latexmk`. Now
you should be built on your directory.

## Troubleshooting

Not enough have happened yet.
